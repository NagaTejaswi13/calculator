### 1. Basic Calculator
**Description**: My first-ever Django project, a basic calculator, allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). It is designed with a functional UI, and I learned a lot about Django views, templates, and form handling while creating this.

**Features**:
- Interactive number input and operation buttons.
- Real-time display of calculations.
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs.

**How to Run**:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `python manage.py runserver` and open the project in your browser.

## Why This Repository?
This repository marks my entry into the world of web development. I started learning coding with Python, and now I'm exploring Django to deepen my understanding and gain real-world experience. This is just the beginning, and I plan to keep adding more projects as I learn.
